## Test environments
* Local OS X install, R 4.2.0: Passed all checks.
* GitHub Actions (linux, macOS, and Windows): Passed all checks via `rhub_check`.

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE:
* Possible misspellings in citation due to author names and algorithm names.
* Some DOIs are unreachable, though they are accessible locally.

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of `funMoDisco`, and all packages passed without issues.
