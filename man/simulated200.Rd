\title{Simulated data for local clustering}
\usage{
data(simulated200)
}
\description{
18 curves of length 200 (corresponding to 201 evaluation points), each
containing exactly one motif of length 60 (corresponding to 61 evaluation
points), with noise level sigma=0.1
Curves 1-6, 14-16 contain one occurrence of motif 1
Curves 7-13, 17-18 contain one occurrence of motif 2
The data have been generated using a B-spline basis of order 3 and knots at
distance 10, following the simulation procedure presented in Cremona and
Chiaromonte (Comparison with non-sparse and sparse functional clustering
simulation section).
