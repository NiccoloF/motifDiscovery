}
\arguments{
\item{filter_candidate_motifs_results}{A list containing results from filtering candidate motifs, including various components like `Y0`, `Y1`, `V0_clean`, `V1_clean`, `D_clean`, and more, which are essential for the clustering process.}

\item{motif_overlap}{A numeric value representing the minimum proportion of overlap required between motifs to be considered similar (default is 0.6).}

\item{k_knn}{An integer specifying the number of nearest neighbors to consider when determining the global radius (default is 3).}

\item{votes_knn_Rall}{A numeric value indicating the threshold for KNN voting when determining the global radius (default is 0.5).}

\item{votes_knn_Rm}{A numeric value indicating the threshold for KNN voting when determining group-specific radii (default is 0.5).}

\item{worker_number}{An optional integer specifying the number of parallel workers to use. If NULL, it defaults to the number of available cores minus one.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
- `VV_D`: Matrix of distances between motifs.
- `VV_S`: Matrix of shifts between motifs.
- `k_knn`: The value of K used in KNN.
- `votes_knn_Rall`: Voting threshold for the global radius.
- `R_all`: The global radius determined from the clustering process.
- `hclust_res`: Result of hierarchical clustering (if applicable).
- `votes_knn_Rm`: Voting threshold for group-specific radius.
- `R_m`: Vector of group-specific radii for each cluster.
- All components from the input `filter_candidate_motifs_results`.
}
\description{
This function clusters candidate motifs based on their distances and computes group-specific radii for motif clusters. It utilizes K-nearest neighbors (KNN) for determining a global radius and evaluates overlaps among motifs. The function supports parallel computation for efficiency.
}
\details{
This function performs the following steps:
1. Sets up parallel jobs based on the specified `worker_number`.
2. Prepares input data based on the type of distance measure used.
3. Computes distances between motifs.
4. Determines a global radius (`R_all`) using KNN classification.
5. Clusters motifs and determines group-specific radii (`R_m`) for each cluster.
