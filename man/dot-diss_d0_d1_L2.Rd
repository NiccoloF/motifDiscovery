\usage{
.diss_d0_d1_L2(y, v, w, alpha, transform_y = FALSE, transform_v = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A list of two matrices: 
\itemize{
  \item \code{y[[1]]}: Values of the curve at points in the domain (y(x)).
  \item \code{y[[2]]}: Values of the derivative of the curve at the same points (y'(x)).
}
Each matrix should have \code{d} columns, where \code{d} is the dimensionality of the curves.}

\item{v}{A list of two matrices: 
\itemize{
  \item \code{v[[1]]}: Values of the reference curve at points in the domain (v(x)).
  \item \code{v[[2]]}: Values of the derivative of the reference curve at the same points (v'(x)).
}
Each matrix should have \code{d} columns, where \code{d} is the dimensionality of the curves.}

\item{w}{A numeric vector of weights for the dissimilarity index in different dimensions. Each weight should be greater than 0.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value (between 0 and 1) that specifies the weight coefficient between the L2 norm of the function (d0.L2) and the L2 norm of the derivative (d1.L2):
\itemize{
  \item \code{alpha = 0}: Only the levels (d0.L2) are considered.
  \item \code{alpha = 1}: Only the derivative information (d1.L2) is considered.
  \item Values between 0 and 1 provide a mixture of both.
}}

\item{transform_y}{A logical value indicating whether to normalize \code{y} to the range [0, 1] before applying the distance computation. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{transform_v}{A logical value indicating whether to normalize \code{v} to the range [0, 1] before applying the distance computation. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the dissimilarity index between the curves defined by \code{y} and \code{v}.
}
\description{
Computes a Sobolev-type dissimilarity index for multidimensional curves based on a weighted combination of L2 norms of the function and its derivative. 
The distance is normalized on a common support, allowing for a comparison between curves considering both their levels and variations.
}
\details{
The dissimilarity index is calculated based on the following Sobolev-type distance:
\deqn{D = (1 - \alpha) \cdot d0.L2 + \alpha \cdot d1.L2}
where:
\itemize{
  \item \code{d0.L2}: L2 distance considering only the levels of the curves.
  \item \code{d1.L2}: L2 distance considering only the derivatives of the curves.
}

The function normalizes the inputs based on the specified flags to ensure that all features are comparable.

\dontrun{
# Define two curves and their derivatives
