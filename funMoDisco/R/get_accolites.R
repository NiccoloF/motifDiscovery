#' @title Get Accolites for a Given Leaf Label
#'
#' @description
#' This function retrieves the accolites (adjacent elements) of a specified leaf label from a dataset. 
#' Accolites are defined as the elements that overlap with the specified portion length around the leaf.
#' The function can filter accolites based on their origin curve in cases where multiple curves are present.
#'
#' @param leaf_label A character string representing the label of the leaf for which to find accolites.
#' @param window_data A data frame or matrix where the row names correspond to the labels of elements,
#'                    containing the data from which accolites will be extracted.
#' @param portion_len An integer specifying the total length of the portion used to define the accolites. 
#'                    The overlap is computed as half of this length.
#' @param multiple A logical indicating whether to check for multiple curves. If TRUE, the function 
#'                 filters out accolites that do not originate from the same curve as the specified leaf label.
#'
#' @return A character vector containing the labels of the identified accolites. 
#'         If no accolites are found, the function returns an empty vector.
#'
#' @details
#' The function works as follows:
#' 1. It calculates the index of the specified leaf label within the provided `window_data`.
#' 2. Determines the range of indices representing the accolites by calculating the overlap based on `portion_len`.
#' 3. Retrieves the corresponding leaf labels from the `window_data`.
#' 4. If the `multiple` argument is TRUE, it checks if the accolites come from the same curve as the leaf label, 
#'    removing those that do not.
