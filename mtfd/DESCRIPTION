Description: method to locally cluster curves and discover functional motifs,
             i.e. typical “shapes” that may recur several times along and across the curves capturing
             important local characteristics. In order to identify these shared curve portions, such
             method leverages ideas from functional data analysis (joint clustering and alignment of
             curves), bioinformatics (local alignment through the extension of high similarity seeds)
             and fuzzy clustering (curves belonging to more than one cluster, if they contain more
             than one typical “shape”). It can employ various dissimilarity measures and incorporate 
             derivatives in the discovery process, thus exploiting complex facets of shapes.
             Additionally, the package includes functionality to simulate functional data with embedded motifs. 
             This feature allows users to create benchmark datasets to test the algorithms, 
             ensuring robust validation and comparison of motif discovery methods.
