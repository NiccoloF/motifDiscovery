Description: 
    This package provides tools for discovering functional motifs and clustering misaligned curves 
    by implementing two complementary algorithms: ProbKMA and FunBIalign. 
    ProbKMA (Cremona and Chiaromonte, 2020) is a probabilistic K-means algorithm that leverages 
    local alignment and fuzzy clustering to identify recurring patterns or motifs across and 
    within curves, allowing portions of curves to belong to multiple clusters. It efficiently 
    handles the alignment of curve portions and adapts motif lengths in a data-driven manner, 
    making it highly flexible for complex functional data. FunBIalign (Di Iorio, Cremona, and 
    Chiaromonte, 2023) uses hierarchical agglomerative clustering with a functional 
    generalization of the Mean Squared Residue Score to discover motifs in both single curves 
    and sets of curves. This approach is particularly adept at identifying local structures and 
    relationships among curves, with no need for multiple initializations or re-running the algorithm. 
    The package also includes functionality to simulate functional data with embedded motifs, 
    allowing users to create benchmark datasets to validate and compare motif discovery methods.
