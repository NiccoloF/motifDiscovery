\title{Find Occurrences of a Motif}
\usage{
.find_occurrences(v, Y, R, alpha, w, c_k, use0, use1, transformed = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{v}{A list containing two matrices:
- \code{v0}: The first set of motif values.
- \code{v1}: The second set of motif values.
Each matrix should have \( d \) columns corresponding to the dimensions.}

\item{Y}{A list of \( N \) lists, each containing two matrices:
- \code{Y0}: The first set of curve values.
- \code{Y1}: The second set of curve values.
Each matrix should have \( d \) columns corresponding to the dimensions.}

\item{R}{A numeric value representing the maximum allowed dissimilarity.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value that serves as a weight coefficient between the L2 norms 
of the two sets of motifs when using the dissimilarity function \code{diss_d0_d1_L2}.}

\item{w}{A numeric vector of weights for the dissimilarity index across different dimensions.
All weights must be positive (\( w > 0 \)).}

\item{c_k}{An integer specifying the minimum length of the intersection of the supports 
of the shifted motif and the curves.}

\item{use0}{A logical value indicating whether to use the first component of the curves (i.e., \( Y0 \) and \( v0 \)).}

\item{use1}{A logical value indicating whether to use the second component of the curves (i.e., \( Y1 \) and \( v1 \)).}

\item{transformed}{A logical value indicating whether the curves have been normalized prior to dissimilarity calculation.}
}
\value{
A matrix with three columns:
        - \code{curve}: The ID of the curve where the motif was found.
        - \code{shift}: The optimal shift at which the motif occurs.
        - \code{diss}: The dissimilarity value associated with the match.
        If no occurrences are found, an empty matrix is returned.
}
\description{
Finds occurrences of a specified motif in a set of curves, where the dissimilarity is lower than a specified threshold \( R \). 
The function compares the motif against curves represented in multiple dimensions and returns the details of matching occurrences.
}
\details{
The function systematically checks each curve in the provided list against the specified motif 
to identify positions where the dissimilarity does not exceed the defined threshold \( R \). 
It handles multidimensional curves and can selectively consider different components of the motifs and curves.

\examples{
# Example usage
v <- list(v0 = matrix(runif(100), ncol = 2), v1 = matrix(runif(100), ncol = 2))
Y <- list(list(Y0 = matrix(runif(200), ncol = 2), Y1 = matrix(runif(200), ncol = 2)))
result <- .find_occurrences(v = v, Y = Y, R = 0.5, alpha = 0.5, w = c(1, 1), c_k = 5, use0 = TRUE, use1 = TRUE)
print(result)
