\usage{
motifSimulationBuilder(
  N,
  len,
  mot_details,
  norder = 3,
  coeff_min = -15,
  coeff_max = 15,
  dist_knots = 10,
  min_dist_motifs = NULL,
  distribution = "unif"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{An integer specifying the number of background curves to be generated (mandatory).}

\item{len}{An integer specifying the length of the background curves (mandatory).}

\item{mot_details}{A list outlining the definitions of the motifs to be included. Each motif is characterized by its length, a set of coefficients that may be optionally specified, and the number of occurrences. These occurrences can be indicated either by specific positions within the curves or by a total count. In the latter case, the algorithm will randomly position the motifs throughout the curves (mandatory).}

\item{norder}{An integer specifying the order of the B-splines (mandatory).}

\item{coeff_min}{Additive coefficients to be incorporated into the generation of coefficients for the background curves (default = -15).}

\item{coeff_max}{Additive coefficients to be incorporated into the generation of coefficients for the background curves (default = 15).}

\item{dist_knots}{An integer specifying the distance between two consecutive knots (default = 10).}

\item{min_dist_motifs}{An integer specifying the minimum distance between two consecutive motifs embedded in the same curve (default = 'norder' * 'dist_knots').}

\item{distribution}{A character string specifying the distribution from which the coefficients of the background curves are generated. You can choose between a uniform distribution or a beta distribution. Alternatively, you can pass a vector representing the empirical distribution from which you wish to sample (default = "unif").}
